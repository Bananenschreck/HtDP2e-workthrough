### Solutions to exercises in How to Design Programs Second Edition
[HtDP Online Textbook](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/)

I took on the challenge of completing every exercise in this book as an introduction to CS and programming text and preparation for more advanced functional programming texts... and Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. I had no academic instruction; answers are only verifiable by code that passes the tests according to the problem statements, so I could very much have written code that fails edge case tests but the solutions can at least help get you thinking about a better solution. Happy coding!

##### Note
> DrRacket automatically saves files containing comment boxes and/or images in a special format, rather than plain text. For exercises containing images, I have left the images in the solution files. Hence, I recommend downloading the file to view in DrRacket.
