;; Q - The performance of how-many is O(n) where n is the length of
;;     the list. Does the accumulator version improve on this?

;; A - No. The accumulator traverses the entire list as well which means that
;;     as n increases, so will the time to process the list with the accumulator
;;     style how-many function.

;; Q - When you evaluate (how-many some-non-empty-list) by hand, n applications
;;     of add1 are pending by the time the function reaches '()â€”where n is the
;;     number of items on the list. Computer scientists sometime say that how-many
;;     needs O(n) space to represent these pending function applications.
;;     Does the accumulator reduce the amount of space needed to compute the result?

;; A - Yes the accumulator reduces the amount of space needed because each recursive
;;     call when carrying an accumulator is a new, non-pending function call i.e. old
;;     function calls do not wait for other recursive calls to finish; thus reducing
;;     the space needed to compute the result.
