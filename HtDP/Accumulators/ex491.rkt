;; Q - Does your friendâ€™s solution mean there is no need for our
;;     complicated design in this motivational section?

;; A - reverse visits every element of a given list and so does foldr.
;;     For a call to relative->absolute, the entire rest of the list is
;;     traversed in a call to reverse, then its result is traversed by
;;     foldr after which it is again processed by another reverse call.
;;     These calls are not nested, meaning that if the number of items in
;;     l are doubled, then the time taken will consequently double.
;;     Thus, while the number of operations in this implementation is 3n,
;;     it is still in the order of O(n) as 3n is indeed a linear relationship.
