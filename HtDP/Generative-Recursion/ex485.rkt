;; Q - What is its abstract running time?
;; A - It runs on the order of n where n is the number of nodes in the tree.


;; Q - What is an acceptable measure of the size of such a tree?
;; A - Its number of nodes (numbers).


;; Q - What is the worst possible shape of the tree?
;; A - A tree with two branches the whole way down to the nodes i.e. all leaf
;;     nodes are at the deepest level of the tree.


;; Q - Whatâ€™s the best possible shape?
;; A - A tree with only one node.
